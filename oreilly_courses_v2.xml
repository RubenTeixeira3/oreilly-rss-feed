The model-as-a-service approach has transformed AI from an esoteric discipline into a powerful development tool that anyone can use. Everyone, including those with minimal or no prior AI experience, can now leverage AI models to build applications. In this book, author Chip Huyen discusses AI engineering: the process of building applications with readily available foundation models.  
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
The book starts with an overview of AI engineering, explaining how it differs from traditional ML engineering and discussing the new AI stack. The more AI is used, the more opportunities there are for catastrophic failures, and therefore, the more important evaluation becomes. This book discusses different approaches to evaluating open-ended models, including the rapidly growing AI-as-a-judge approach.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
AI application developers will discover how to navigate the AI landscape, including models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, and the seemingly infinite number of use cases and application patterns. You&amp;#x27;ll learn a framework for developing an AI application, starting with simple techniques and progressing toward more sophisticated methods, and discover how to efficiently deploy these applications.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Understand what AI engineering is and how it differs from traditional machine learning engineering 
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learn the process for developing an AI application, the challenges at each step, and approaches to address them 
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Explore various model adaptation techniques, including prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, agents, and dataset engineering, and understand how and why they work
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Examine the bottlenecks for latency and cost when serving foundation models and learn how to overcome them
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Choose the right model, dataset, evaluation benchmarks, and metrics for your needs
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Chip Huyen works to accelerate data analytics on GPUs at Voltron Data. Previously, she was with Snorkel AI and NVIDIA, founded an AI infrastructure startup, and taught Machine Learning Systems Design at Stanford. She&amp;#x27;s the author of the book Designing Machine Learning Systems, an Amazon bestseller in AI.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;AI Engineering&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; builds upon and is complementary to &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Designing Machine Learning Systems (O&amp;#x27;Reilly)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;</description><enclosure url="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/cover/9781098166298/" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hands-On Large Language Models üë®‚Äçüè´ Jay Alammar, Maarten Grootendorst üìÖ 2024-09-11</title><link>https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-large-language/9781098150952/</link><description>&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;AI has acquired startling new language capabilities in just the past few years.

In &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; bestselling author Sebastian Raschka guides you step by step through creating your own LLM. Each stage is explained with clear text, diagrams, and examples. You‚Äôll go from the initial design and creation, to pretraining on a general corpus, and on to fine-tuning for specific tasks.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; teaches you how to:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;

Plenty of tutorials are available to teach Go&amp;#x27;s syntax to developers with experience in other programming languages, but tutorials aren&amp;#x27;t enough. They don&amp;#x27;t teach Go&amp;#x27;s idioms, so developers end up recreating patterns that don&amp;#x27;t make sense in a Go context. This practical guide provides the essential background you need to write clear and idiomatic Go.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
No matter your level of experience, you&amp;#x27;ll learn how to think like a Go developer. Author Jon Bodner introduces the design patterns experienced Go developers have adopted and explores the rationale for using them. This updated edition also shows you how Go&amp;#x27;s generics support fits into the language.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
This book helps you:
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Write idiomatic code in Go and design a Go project
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Understand the reasons behind Go&amp;#x27;s design decisions 
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Set up a Go development environment for a solo developer or team
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learn how and when to use reflection, unsafe, and cgo
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Discover how Go&amp;#x27;s features allow the language to run efficiently
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Know which Go features you should use sparingly or not at all
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Use Go&amp;#x27;s tools to improve performance, optimize memory usage, and reduce garbage collection
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Learn how to use Go&amp;#x27;s advanced development tools

As the models become increasingly capable, we have witnessed a new design pattern emerge: AI agents. By combining tools, knowledge, memory, and learning with advanced foundation models, we can now sequence multiple model inferences together to solve ambiguous and difficult problems. From coding agents to research agents to analyst agents and more, we&amp;#x27;ve already seen agents accelerate teams and organizations. While these agents enhance efficiency, they often require extensive planning, drafting, and revising to complete complex tasks, and deploying them remains a challenge for many organizations, especially as technology and research rapidly develops.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This book is your indispensable guide through this intricate and fast-moving landscape. Author Michael Albada provides a practical and research-based approach to designing and implementing single- and multiagent systems. It simplifies the complexities and equips you with the tools to move from concept to solution efficiently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Understand the distinct features of foundation model-enabled AI agents
&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Discover the core components and design principles of AI agents
